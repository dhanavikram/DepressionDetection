# Timeline
* April 17-April 21: Create combined CSV, perform data cleaning and preprocessing
* April 22-April 27: Perform model building, compare different modeling results for classifying both gender and depression
* April 28-29: look at mitigating bias and most informative features
* April 30-May 1: make poster and report

# Tasks
* Erin: making clean data script, transformations, run PCA (generate scree plot to pick # of components), regularization
* Dayn: assessing correlations between variables, building feature set not associated with gender, criteria for informative feature set
* Dhanavikram: work on padding CSVs to facilitate CNNs, model optimization (finetuning hyperparameters)
* Kalyani: trying fully connected networks and CNNs, random forests
